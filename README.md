# bike-store-powerbi-dashboard
Welcome to the Bike Store Analytics Dashboard – a data-driven project that transforms raw bike rental data into powerful business insights using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes two years' worth of bike rental data to answer key business questions such as:

When are we making the most money?
How do seasons and times of day affect revenue?
What impact does pricing have on rider demand?
Who are our riders – casual or registered?
Using SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for interactive data visualization, this dashboard uncovers meaningful patterns to support strategic decision-making.

💾 Tech Stack
Database: Microsoft SQL Server
Data Modeling & Queries: T-SQL (CTEs, joins, calculations)
Visualization: Microsoft Power BI
Data Analysis: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

📊 Key Insights
💸 Revenue Peaks: Highest earnings occur at 5 PM and 6 PM, aligning with post-work hours.
📈 Pricing Strategy: A 25% price increase led to a 64% surge in rider demand — showing elasticity in rider behavior.
📅 Seasonal Trends: Season 3 (likely summer) generated the highest revenue.
👥 Rider Demographic: Over 81% of users are registered riders, but casual users account for significant daily fluctuations.
⏰ Profitability by Hour: Midday to early evening (10 AM – 3 PM) are the most profitable hours.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
✅ SQL querying (data transformation using CTEs, UNION, calculated columns)
✅ DAX (custom KPIs and measures)
✅ Power BI dashboard design (clean UI with slicers, cards, and visuals)
✅ Business storytelling with data
